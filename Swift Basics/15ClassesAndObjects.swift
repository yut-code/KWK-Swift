"subject" is studying Swift
"name" of scholar is Ophelia  */

// üéº Practice: Classes & Objects
/* With your partner, brainstorm another class. Remember, we used Scholar because all scholars share some things, and also had some unique things about them. If you are struggling for an idea, Car and Dog are both commonly used to practice work with classes üöó üê∂

  1. With your partner, write a list of properties your class should have. What is true about every ____? (If you are talking about a car, every car has wheels...)

  Properties of the Dog Class:
    * Fur Colour
    * Colour of Eyes
    * If the dog is happy

What function, or action, do you want your _____ to take? (If it's a dog, I would want it to bark, sit, fetch...) Come up with at least 2 actions!

  Actions for _____:
    * Wag tail
    * Bark
    * Sit

Write your class! Be sure to:
- Create variables for the properties your class needs
- Write the actions for your class
- Create at least one object with this class and do some printing to make sure your class is behaving as expected
- Add in an init function so you can pass your class something specific to the object you are creating. (For a car, I would definitely want to make sure the color could change!) */

class Dog {
  var happiness = true
  var name = ""

  // happy is an optional parameter
  init(dogName: String, happy : Bool = true) {
    name = dogName
    happiness = happy
  }

  func wagTail() {
    if happiness {
      print("\(name) is wagging their tail!")
    } else {
      print("The dog is sad... It doesn't feel like wagging their tail.")
    }
  }

  func bark() {
    print("Ruff!")
  }
  
}
var puppy = Dog(dogName: "Belle")
var puppy2 = Dog(dogName: "Dan", happy: false)

puppy2.wagTail()
puppy.bark()
