// 🥨 Try It: Looping Over Arrays 

//  1. Declare an array of the names of five scholars around you. 
let scholars = ["Isabella", "Sophia", "Olivia", "Ava", "Mia"]

//  2. Write a for-in loop that uses each name and prints "Hello, [scholar’s name]" to the console
for scholar in scholars {

}

//  3. Declare an array of the names of four things you already learned about Swift
let swiftBasics = ["Loops", "Arrays", "String Interpolation", "Dictionaries"]

//  4. Write a for-in loop that uses each thing you already learned and prints "I learned [thing you learned] at KWK" to the console
